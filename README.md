HW02: Math Function

The exercise involves developing a class to represent polynomial functions.

The class should support the following operations:

Creating a new polynomial function with given coefficients.
Calculating the value of the function at a given point.
Calculating the derivative of the function.
Calculating the integral of the function (using the trapezoidal method).
Finding the roots of the function (using bisection and Newton-Raphson methods).
Calculating the Taylor polynomial for the function.
Creating a string representation for the function.
Comparing two polynomial functions.
Calculating the sum, difference, product, and quotient of two polynomial functions.
Calculating the power of a polynomial function.
